## GAM Roadmap

- Automate the publishing process to PyPi
    - Use newly proposed Open Source Office Standards from DataProfiler
- Decouple k-medoid clustering from GAM core
    - Restructure tests to accommodate this decoupling
- Address GAM Examples
    - Decouple dependencies of the examples from the core logic	
      - ie. add example requirements to the extra-requires dependencies
    - Ensure examples are up to date and functional
- Research the industry gap on k-medoid clustering
- Determine the viability of contributing our k-medoid clustering algorithm to something like scikit learn
- Determine the viability of creating a new open source project that provides k-medoid clustering
- Reference FairGAMe?
